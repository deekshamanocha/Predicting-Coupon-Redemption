# Predicting-Coupon-Redemption

This project focuses on predicting coupon redemption using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer demographics, transaction history, and campaign metadata, models like LightGBM and CatBoost were trained to estimate the likelihood of a coupon being redeemed. The dataset was processed and evaluated using Stratified K-Fold cross-validation with AUC-ROC as the performance metric. The final output is a prediction file indicating the probability of redemption for each coupon-user pair, helping businesses target users more effectively and optimize marketing efforts.
